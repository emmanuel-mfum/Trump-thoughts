# Trump-thoughts
Small Python program made using Tkinter and making calls to  an API for some....interesting quotes.

To run the program simply run the "main.py" file and make sure the two other images are in the same directory.
To make the quotes appear on the yellow space, simply press the button made up of the Trump photo.
